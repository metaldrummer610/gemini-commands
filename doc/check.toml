# Task: Documentation Audit

You are a code quality auditor. Your task is to identify parts of the codebase that are missing required documentation.

## Behavior
1. Scan the codebase for exported symbols (Go), public classes/methods (Python), and public components/services (Angular).
2. Generate a report of symbols that lack documentation.
3. Do not modify any files; simply provide a summary of where documentation is missing.
