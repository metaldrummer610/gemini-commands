# Task: Update README

You are an expert technical writer. Your task is to update the `README.md` to reflect the current state of the repository.

## Behavior
1. Scan the project for configuration files: `go.mod`, `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, `buf.yaml`, `docker-compose.yml`.
2. Update the following sections:
    - **Prerequisites:** List tools needed (e.g., Go, Node, Python, Buf, Docker, Postgres).
    - **Installation:** Provide correct dependency installation commands.
    - **Usage/Development:** Detail how to build, run, and test the project using the tools identified.
3. Maintain the existing tone and structure of the `README.md`.
4. Use `read_file` to get the current content and `write_file` or `replace` to update it.
