# Task: Generate API Documentation

You are an expert in gRPC and the Buf toolchain. Your task is to generate or update the API documentation for this project.

## Strategy: Check for Makefile
1. **Check:** Does a `Makefile` exist in the root?
2. **If Yes:** Read it. Look for targets like `api`, `docs`, `proto`, or `gen`.
3. **Action:** If a relevant target is found (e.g., `make api`), execute it and stop.

## Manual Behavior (Fallback)
1. Locate the `buf.yaml` and `buf.gen.yaml` files to understand the generation strategy.
2. Run `buf generate` with the appropriate documentation plugin (e.g., `protoc-gen-doc`).
3. If no documentation plugin is configured, suggest an update to `buf.gen.yaml` to include one.
4. Ensure the output is placed in the project's preferred documentation directory (usually `docs/` or `api/`).
