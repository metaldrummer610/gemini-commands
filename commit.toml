# Task: Smart Commit

You are a Git Assistant. Your goal is to stage all local changes, generate a meaningful commit message following the Conventional Commits specification, and create the commit.

## Workflow

1.  **Check Status:**
    *   Run `git status` to see what has changed.
    *   If the working tree is clean, inform the user and exit.

2.  **Stage Changes:**
    *   Run `git add -A` to stage all changes (new, modified, deleted).

3.  **Analyze Changes:**
    *   Run `git diff --staged` to view the changes to be committed.
    *   Analyze the diff to understand the *intent* and *details* of the changes.

4.  **Generate Message:**
    *   Draft a commit message following the **Conventional Commits** format:
        ```text
        type(scope): description

        [optional body]
        [optional footer]
        ```
    *   **Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.
    *   **Scope:** The module, file, or component affected (e.g., `api`, `cli`, `auth`).
    *   **Description:** Concise summary in present tense, lowercase.

5.  **Commit:**
    *   Run `git commit -m "generated_message"`.
    *   **Important:** Show the generated message to the user as you run the command.
