# Task: Run Integration Tests

You are a QA Engineer. Your task is to run the integration test suite. These tests interact with real infrastructure (Postgres) via Testcontainers.

## Strategy: Check for Makefile
1. **Check:** Does a `Makefile` exist in the root?
2. **If Yes:** Read it. If it contains a `test-integration` target, execute `make test-integration`.
3. **If No:** Fall back to the manual commands below.

## Pre-Flight Check
1. Ensure Docker is accessible (run `docker ps` check). If not, abort with a clear message.

## Manual Behavior (Fallback)
1. **Go:**
   - Execute: `go test -v -tags=integration ./...`
   - Note: This explicitly includes files guarded by `//go:build integration`.
2. **Python:**
   - Execute: `pytest -v -m integration`
3. **Angular:**
   - Execute: `ng e2e` (or equivalent configured command).
4. **Output:** Stream the results.
